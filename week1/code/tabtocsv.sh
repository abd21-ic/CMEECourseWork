# Script: tabtocsv.sh
# Descripton: substitute the tabs in files with commas
#
# Saves the output into a .csv file
# Arguments: 1 -> tab delimited file
#
# Practical: Write a csvtospace.sh shell script that takes a comma separated values and converts it to a space separated values file. However, it must not change the input file â€” it should save it as a differently named file.
