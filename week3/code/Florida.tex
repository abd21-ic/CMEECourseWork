\section{Results}
We imported the Key West Annual Mean Temperature data given to us, and calulated a correlation coefficient. We then randomised the years and the temperatures in a million samples and performed a correlation test for each of the samples. We then compared the correlations between the sample set and the Florida data to calulated a rudimentary p-value.

\section{Results}
Having imported the Key West Annual Mean Temperature data (the basis for our Florida data), there was a correlation of:

\[ 0.5331784 \]

Out of one million random samples of temperatures and years, taken from the Florida data, not a single sample had a correlation greater than the Florida correlation.

\section{Interpretation}
The Florida data is statistically significant as the rudimentary p-value is lower than 0.05. Any null hypothesis (there is no correlation between temperature and years in the Florida data) can be rejected.
